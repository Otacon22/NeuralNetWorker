This is NeuralNetWorker, a fast and simple program to work with
feed-forward neural networks. Authors hope that this program will
be useful and comfortable for many applications, if not you can 
send to the current mantainer a protest email.

The aim of the program is to be used from a shell (expecially on
the Bash). If you want to use it as a library do it at your own
risk.

NeuralNetWorker is provided "as is" with no warranty.  The exact
terms under which you may use and (re)distribute this program are
detailed in the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.
